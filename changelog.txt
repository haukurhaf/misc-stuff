Version 1.2.0:
	
	Some flash based streams where not working (for example sports/EPL).  Needed to add special handling for those to work.

Version 1.1.0:

	Support for live broadcasts (when airing)
	Support for paging in video lists

Version 1.0.0:
	
	Inital release.
	Limitations in this version:  Live broadcasts from Stod2 are not supported yet.  The plugin does not support paging - it only loads the first 18 videos in each category.
