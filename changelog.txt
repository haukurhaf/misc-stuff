Version 1.3.0:
	
	A complete redesign of http://www.visir.is/ (where all the data is scraped from) caused a total failure of the plugin.  Scraper functionality updated to work with the new web site.
	Note: some streams may still be broken as it has not been tested thoroughly.  Live TV not tested at all, most likely stil broken.
	
Version 1.2.0:
	
	Some flash based streams where not working (for example sports/EPL).  Needed to add special handling for those to work.

Version 1.1.0:

	Support for live broadcasts (when airing)
	Support for paging in video lists

Version 1.0.0:
	
	Inital release.
	Limitations in this version:  Live broadcasts from Stod2 are not supported yet.  The plugin does not support paging - it only loads the first 18 videos in each category.
